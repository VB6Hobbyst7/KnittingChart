# IRMA HAT

## Preamble

The hat is knitted in the round from the bottom to the top.
I recommend using the magicloop technique.
One size. easily adjustable by adding or subtracting a multiple of 8 sts from the
number given in the pattern instructions.
A single pattern repeat (8 sts, 14 rounds) adds/subtracts ca. 3 cm in circumference and
5 cm in depth.

**Gauge**: 22 sts and 28 rows for 10x10 cm with 4.5 mm needles in St st.
**Yarn**: Malabrigo Rios or any DK or light worsted substitute. 1 skein.
**Needles**: 4.5 mm as main needles, 3.5 mm for the ribbed brim
**Other accessories**: 1 stitch marker, darning needle.

## Abbreviations
